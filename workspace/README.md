# Disaster Response Pipeline Project
In this project I implimenting data engineering process in building an ETL and a NLP pipeline as well as creating a web app with flask. As part of my task I would be reparing the data with an ETL pipeline and using a machine learning to build a supervised learning model.

## ACKNOWLEDGE

## DATA CREDIT

UDACITY
FIGURE8

Figure 8 provided me with pre-labeled tweets and text message from real life disasters.

## PROJECT MOTIVATION
Following a disaster, disaster agencies get millions of communication either directly or via social media at the same time. At this point, disaster organizations have the least capacity to filter and pull messages that are most important which is typically one in a thousand. When a disaster occurs dIfferent organisation usually take care of different part of the problem. These different scope of operation would be used to split the messages into categories

## Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl'

2. Go to `app` directory: `cd app`

3. Run your web app: `python run.py`

4. Click the `PREVIEW` button to open the homepage
